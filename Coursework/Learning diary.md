# Learning Diary

**Name:** Sangam Thapa

## What I Learned:
- Setting up Android Studio and running an emulator
- Writing Composable functions in Jetpack Compose
- Handling user input, UI state, and dark mode
- Managing navigation with `NavController`

## Challenges I Faced:
- Gradle dependency syncing issues
- Passing state (like dark mode) between screens
- Getting UI to update on theme change

## Favorite Parts:
- How simple Jetpack Compose makes UI building
- Using `LazyColumn` for note display
- Theme switching (dark mode!)

## Reflection:
This project helped me learn real-world Android development tools and patterns. I'm now confident using Compose and navigating between screens.
